sequence():
    initialize n*m array, going across increment by 5 (insert/delete), going diagonal increment by 1 (substitution) unless equel then -3 (match)
    (left delete from left column, right delete from right column)
    iterating at i=1, j=1 to i=n, j=m
        compare left, diagonal, and above to find the smallest value
        store pointer

    return last value as cost
    traverse back for alignments
        move diagonal, both have original value
        move left or up, dash and keep one original


sequenceBanded():
    left = left
    diagnol = up
    up = right diagonal
